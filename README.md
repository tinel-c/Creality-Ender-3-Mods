## MKS GEN-L motherboard

The MKS Gen-L 1.0 8 Bit 3D Printer Controller Board is designed by Makerbase and is a combination of the Arduino Mega 2560 and the RAMPS 1.4 board in a smaller and more cost effective package than the MKS Gen 1.4 controller board.  It has the same capability as the RAMPS board with the following advantages:  It can run from 12 â€“ 24V for those high power applications, it consists of a single board with improved thermal control, it has an improved USB controller and the connector for the screen is already on the board.
